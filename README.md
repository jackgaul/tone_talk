# ToneTalk Blog 📄

This is the repo for my blog which can be found at [tonetalk.dev](https://tonetalk.dev).
The Website
AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. This theme is designed and crafted based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme follows best practices and provides accessibility out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default. Moreover, additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. Read [the blog posts](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/) or check [the README Documentation Section](#-documentation) for more info.
