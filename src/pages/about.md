My name is Jack Gaul and I am currently a Master's student at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science and Engineering. I recieved my Bachelor's from Santa Clara University in 2021 and then worked at Verkada as a Solutions Engineer and a Product Engineer while I worked on my Masters partime. After two years, I decided to commit my full attention to completing my Masters. My expected Graduation date is December 2024.

The goal of this blog is to showcase both my writings and projects. My writings are centered around my fascination with Communication (between "systems"), systems engineering, cognitive linguistics, language, and AI.

At the core of my writings, I attempt to grapple with a constellation of questions of how we as humans(as well as general systems) encode the world around us and communicate our encodings to other humans(as well as genral systems): 

Mental Model Representation: Opinion Space

- What are the "data structures" we use to model the world? 
- What is the structure and dynamics of the object-space where these mental "data-structures" exist?


Communication

- How do we transmit these ideas to others around us? 
- What steps can we take to minimize error in the encoding and transmission process?
- What are the atomic units of communication that all distinct systems use to communicate? 

Generative AI

- Given the previous conceptions of mental state-space, how these ideas be best utilized when constructiong the interfaces in which we interact with AI informational systems?
- What is *Super Persuasion*?
- What would a post digital communication world look like where we cant trust any source of digital information including phone calls or facetimes from friends and family?

## Gemini's Summation of my Thoughts

I collected most of my writings over the past year and uploaded them to Googles new "Notbooklm". I asked NBLM to summarize my thoughts for the about page. Its answer is as follows:

*I approach these topics by drawing connections to other fields, utilizing analogies, and seeking to uncover the underlying structures that shape our understanding and interactions. I believe that our subjective experiences are built upon a foundation of "metaphorical objects" that we use to make sense of the world.*

*I posit that communication is the "processing of one system affecting the state of another" and that this process can be categorized into distinct types based on the purpose and actions involved. I am particularly interested in the potential for "super-persuasion" and the role of artificial intelligence in influencing opinion dynamics.*

*I propose that each individual's subjective opinion space is a unique construction, influenced by their experiences and logical frameworks. While we strive for a universal logical rule set to describe all opinion spaces, the reality is often more complex, with different sub-spaces governed by their own distinct sets of rules and assumptions.*
