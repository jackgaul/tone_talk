  What are the effects of AI on future communication?

## Motivation




Recently I have been pondering over the future of communication in the digital form and how this type of communication will be impacted by advancements in generative AI. In this blog I will take on assumptions in order to reason logically about a future state. In each of these moments, I will try my best to explicitly call out the most critical assumptions I take. But first, a brief overview of communication and my exposure to frameworks of thought in the communication domain.

To begin, what is communication? At first first thought, this is quite an easy question with a simple answer. However, most people’s answer (as a result of their understanding of the question) leaves much to be desired. One might answer along the lines of “When people talk to each other”. This answer isn't INCORRECT yet it doesn't seem to encompass what communication is in its entirety. I believe this is due to the level abstraction of the words used in the answer. 

The true answer to this question should be worded in such a way that all other answers (that are correct) can collapse down into the true answer. Something like:

- “the replication of information”
- “state at time/location A existing at a later/different location B”

To continue this blog and avoid getting sucked into clarification-holes. I will use the life of a human as a vehicle to discuss the evolution of communication.

Some time soon after we are born we begin to, unknowingly, communicate with the world around us. First we(internal system) receive information from the outside (external system). This comes through many mediums: touch of our parents, sounds through our ears, light through our eyes, taste through our mouth. In this example, I am defining communication as the transmission of information between the external system of the world and in internal system (our CNS). In a way this could abstract to any type of interaction from the sound waves we hear(hitting out eardrums) to two pool balls colliding(two bodies "communicating" kinetic energy). The transmission of state from one system to another defines communication (in the physical sense). 

### Hot Stove 

As we grow older, semantic meaning begins to be associated with the incoming stimuli. A low level example is a hot stove. We feel the temperature and we know that is hot. The hot pan “communicates” its state over the medium of air and the “protocol” defined by thermodynamics. We interpret this state and add semantic meaning which we take or do not take action on. In this example the semantic meaning is only assigned at the receiving system. The pan has no notion of itself “being” hot. Only when the raw stimuli is received by an "intelligent agent" is semantic meaning applied. I point this out to draw a distinction between the next example of communication between two humans. 

The mother of the child walks into the kitchen first and receives the low level “pan message” described above. Just like the child she assigns semantic meaning to this message. She then wishes to share this semantic meaning with the child. Instead of showing the child the low level message and introducing a child ← pan connection in the communication graph so that the child can assign semantic meaning itself, she usings her semantic meaning in her mind to generate a sequence of symbols(the thought → the worded thought), transmits the semantic message to the child through the medium of air and the protocol (physical: fluid dynamics of sound, semantic: rules around conversation). The child receives the physical stimuli, translates it to the symbol representation and then interprets the symbol representation into the semantic meaning. This communication is distinctly different than the first because in both the origin and the destination, the semantic representation exists. More importantly, it is the semantic meaning itself that is being transmitted.

## Up the Human OSI Model We Go

In an analogous way, our human commincation utlizes a communication stack that is similar to the OSI model the internet is built on. The bottom layer being the physical medium in which we send information.
