description: Some thoughts on frameworks of problem solving.
---

For the last few years, a recurring idea has continually grabbed my attention when talking and thinking about problem-solving. This is the idea of **Frameworks.** The origin of this word in my vocabulary originates from my experience with science particularly in physics. (When working in Physics 1, you often are tasked with a problem which you need to figure out if you should use energy equations or momentum equations) I conceptualized it as a set of tools, assumptions(first principles), and ideas that are used to approach problems in the world. One person may have a whole collection of frameworks to choose from and when they come across a problem that they are facing, they deliberately choose one of their frameworks to go about both exploring the problem, conceptualizing the problem, communicating the problem, brainstorming solutions, conceptualizing solutions, and then taking action on that solution. It is possible that some frameworks are better than others at each step of this process. Meaning the problem solving may utilize different frameworks through the whole process. _Better_ in this sense might be a function of time to solve, effort to solve, and complexity of solution.

This process of choosing which framework to to use at each point in the problem solving cylce suggests the existence of _Meta Frameworks_.

A Quick example of a framework comparison: Consider the situation where we might want to make bread. We enlist a chemist and a baker to attempt to solve this problem. Both frameworks of problem-solving are absolutely capable of making bread. However, the baker's problem-solving framework is fine-tuned to this problem and task. The chemist’s framework requires so much overhead and unnecessary pieces of information that are not absolutely required to be explicit in the bread-making process. Furthermore, obviously we would all want the baker's bread in the end as well.
Consider these three facts.

1. **There exist distinct problem-solving frameworks that differ in assumptions, tools, language, ideas, and procedures.**
2. **Given a Problem, a framework's ability to conceptualize the problem( both in the mind of the problem solver and in their ability to communicate it in language) and change the systems state to the desired solution can be “measured”.**
3. **Different frameworks result in different levels of success.**

   We can conclude that there exists a gradient of frameworks with respect to their problem-solving ability.
   In simple language: Some frameworks are better than others at some tasks.
   **Is there a “Best” framework for a task? Is there a best general framework for a task?**
   The selection process of a framework is quite interesting. Choosing a framework to use when solving a problem is itself a problem. I would propose that no problem-solving can exist outside of a framework. Therefore it seems there exists a set of frameworks, which I will call **meta-frameworks,** whose sole function is the selection of the best framework for a task.
